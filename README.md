## About the game "Sea Battle"

Sea Battle is a game in which players take turns choosing coordinates on an unknown opponent's map. If the opponent has a ship at these coordinates (the coordinates are occupied), then the ship or part of it is "drowned", and the hit gets the right to make another move. The player's goal is to sink all enemy ships first.

## Main Features

+ The game supports its own custom rules (width and height).
+ There are islands on the map that are randomly distributed across the map. The number of islands is distributed randomly. They do not allow the user to place ships on the cells occupied by them.
+ The ships are located by the user independently, but he can resort to a random arrangement of the remaining ships.
+ The game allows you to save and load sessions during the game.
