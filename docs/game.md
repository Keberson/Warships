# Game

After going to this section, the player is invited *to place* his ships on the field of the width and height specified in the settings or configuration file. The user has the right to arrange a part (this part may be missing) of the ships independently, and a part randomly.

After the ships are arranged, the game phase begins. The user and the computer take turns choosing cells to *attack*.

The winner is the one who first destroys all the cells. 

During the game, the user can save or load the session, as well as go to the menu. You can read about the menu here -> [Menu](menu.md)
